<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>
  I am a motived dev in training, in search of the start of my carear. I am currently working on Udemy to learn Full Stack
  Web development. I am a fast and determined learner always down to take on a new task. I have my AAS in Information Technology
  and have been working as an account Executive the past 7 years. As an account executive I bring problem solving skills and customer
  support to the table. With my degree, I bring tools that help me to understand technology and quickly learn new computer skills when needed.

</p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>My goal is to finish my Udemy studies within the next year and begin my search for my first job as Junior Web Developer. To do this, I will be
  spending at least an hour a day studying after work as well as listening to podcasts to bring myself up to speed on new topics.

<H2>A little About Me Outside of My Professional Life</H2>
<p>I am the son of two amazing parents, Margo and Charles Baldwin. Without them, I would not have had the privledges and opportunity I had growing up. 
  I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, drooling overs cars, building computers, and gaming. I have many amazing friends I could go on talking about, 
  one of which stands out above the crowed and helped me push on in my goal of being a dev. My good buddy Roman helped me see the path I wanted to continue on down to make one more carear
  change. That is being a professional Netrunner. Nah, I jest. He's the one that changed from being a Chef into being a Full Stack Dev. Which also ignited
  my want to get back into the saddle. 
</p>
<p>When I am not studying to better myself. I am usually chilling at my PC and gaming or binging the next episode of my current TV obsession (they change all the time).
  In the summer you can find me near our families old cabin or hanging out at the local card shop playing magic the gathering, Netrunner, and Warhammer. The best mix of 
  Outdoors and nerd.
