<h1>The Best Movies According to Earl</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
 <p>There are many Fast and Furious movies to watch in this franchise. However, I will always be a sucker for the original. I just felt like the original was about street racing and car culture with some action thrown into the mix. Where as the new ones are all about a ton of action with some car culture thrown in. Completely different in my opinion</p>

 <h3>Rose Red</h3>
 <p>Stephen King will forever be the king of horror. His movie Rose Red was more than just making you dump the popcorn and jump off your seat at a jump scare. It had story, character development, a thrilling plot, and a gorgous scenery to keep you emerged. The pinnacle of horror in my opinion</p>

 <h3>Santa Clause</h3>
 <p>The original Santa Clause will forever hold a place in my heart around the holidays. Tim Allen as always did a great job at playing the Santa Claus. Bring comedy and family drama all into one package. This is a great Christmas story that will keep everyone entertained with just the right amount of happiness, comedy, and sadness that every holiday movie needs. </p>
